# Invisible Shirt Project

This project demonstrates a computer vision application that makes a shirt of a specific color appear **invisible** by replacing it with the captured background.  
It uses **OpenCV** and **NumPy** to detect the defined color range, mask it, and blend it with the background.

## 🚀 Features
- Capture live video feed using webcam.
- Capture the background with a single key press.
- Detect and mask a specific shirt color using **HSV color thresholding**.
- Replace the masked area with the background to create an invisibility effect.
- Real-time visualization with side-by-side original and processed output.
